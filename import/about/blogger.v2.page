Import a site created with Blogger. This option uses public Blogger feed API to fetch the site data. This is the preferred method in general because it just works in most cases. The only drawback is that you can&rsquo;t import user-defined meta description and page views simply because these data is not available in the feed resource.

Make sure you have set the feed content visibility to full.
