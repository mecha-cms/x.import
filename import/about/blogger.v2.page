Import a site created with Blogger. This option uses public Blogger feed API to fetch the site data. This is the preferred method in general because it just works in most cases. The only drawback is that you can&rsquo;t import user-defined meta description and page views simply because these data is not available in the feed resource.

### Blogger Feed Settings

Make sure you have set the blog feed visibility to full. Go to the Blogger dashboard and look on the side bar. Select _Settings_ &rarr; _Other_ &rarr; _Site feed_. Next to _Allow Blog Feed_, select **Full**.

### Import Form Settings

I assume that you are now in the tool page. on the _Tool_ tab, you will see a _Blog ID_ field. Put your blog ID that you want to import there. To get the blog ID, go to the Blogger dashboard, then look at the URL in the address bar. Your blog ID will be contained as the value of `blogID` in the URL parameters.
